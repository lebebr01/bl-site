abstract: "This study investigated the effects of imposing task- or process-oriented reading
behaviors on reading comprehension assessment performance. Students in Grades 5-
8 (N = 275) were randomly assigned to hear multiple-choice items read aloud before or
after reading a test passage and when they were and were not allowed access to the
passage while answering items. A confirmatory factor analysis found a one-factor
model with all test items loading on the comprehension latent variable fit better than
treating literal, inferential, and evaluative items as three separate variables.
Subsequently, a structural equation model explored whether testing condition or other
covariates (state assessment score and student demographics) explained variance in
reading comprehension assessment performance. In Grades 5-6, significant positive
effects were found for students who kept the text while answering items, regardless of
whether or not they previewed the items. In Grades 7-8, no significant differences were
found for the four testing conditions."
